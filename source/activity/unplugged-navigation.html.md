title: Unplugged Navigation
---
Computer scientists spend time breaking problems into smaller problems until all that remains is a list of steps. These steps can be turned into instructions that a computer can understand.

This activity laid a foundation for students to think computationally so that they can eventually solve problems by writing code.

## Navigating a Grid

Students were given a 5x5 grid with a start point, finish point, and obstacles:

Their task was to write a list of instructions to navigate from the start to the finish while remaining on the grid and avoiding obstacles. They were given cards that indicated various instructions such as "take a step", "turn left and step", "turn right and step", and "repeat". In groups, they arranged their instructions as a list next to their grid. They tested their instructions at their own grids and debugged (made changes to solve problems) as necessary. At the end of the class, some groups tested their instructions by navigating a teacher through a large version of the grid with the same configuration.
